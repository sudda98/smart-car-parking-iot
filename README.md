Smart Car Parking System is an Internet of Things initiative. A smartphone application allows users to check the number of free parking spaces inside the car park as well as the names of the free parking spots. Users can also reserve parking spaces before visiting the lot. The Internet is used to send data to the mobile application.

The following technologies were used: Arduino Mega, NodeMCU ESP8266, Firebase, Android Studio, Java, XML, and C++.
